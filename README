SPMK
====
Simple ports and package system. 
Features:

	* dependency resolving,
	* support of binary packages,
	* package signing (currently uses openssl, polarssl is planned).

Ports part implemented in 9base tools (rc, mk). Package management (spmk_add,
spmk_rm) currently implemented in portable POSIX tools (busybox friendly)
since it is intended to work in embedded systems (primarily linux).
Rc-versions of these scripts are planned.

More extensive documentation is not yet written.

Requirements
------------

	* 9base, p9p (tested on 9base)
	* openssl
	* fakeroot
	* tar, gzip
	* coreutils (for cp, mv, rm and package management tools)

Development and testing
-----------------------
`tools` directory contains scripts for generating fake ports tree for testing.
Run `./tools/create-testing-env` for creating `root/` directory with installed
spmk and tree of fake ports in `root/usr/ports`. Then you can execute

  export PATH=`pwd`/root/usr/sbin:$PATH

and play with spmk, spmk_add, spmk_rm.
