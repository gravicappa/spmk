SPMK
====
Simple ports and package system.
Features:

  * dependency resolving,
  * support of binary packages,
  * package signing (currently uses openssl, polarssl is planned).

Ports part implemented in 9base tools (rc, mk). Package management currently
implemented in portable POSIX tools (busybox friendly) and in rc.

More extensive documentation is not yet written.

Requirements
------------

  * 9base, p9p (tested on 9base)
  * openssl
  * fakeroot (used for setting owner as root in package tarball)
  * tar, gzip
  * coreutils (cp, mv, rm)

Slackware backend
-----------------
To build a package for spmk with slackware backend type `mk` in `slackware`
directory.

Development and testing
-----------------------
`tools` directory contains scripts for generating fake ports tree for testing.
Run `./tools/mktestenv` for creating `root/` directory with installed spmk and
tree of fake ports in `root/usr/ports`. Then you can execute

  export PATH=`pwd`/root/usr/sbin:$PATH

and play with spmk and sp.
