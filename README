SPMK
====
Simple ports and package system. Ports part implemented in 9base tools (rc,
mk). Package management (spmk_add, spmk_rm) currently implemented in
portable POSIX tools (busybox friendly) since it is intended to work in
embedded systems (primarily linux). Rc-versions of these scripts are planned.

More extensive documentation is not yet written.

Development and testing
-----------------------
`tools` directory contains scripts for generating fake ports tree for testing.
Run `./tools/create-testing-env` for creating `root/` directory with installed
spmk and tree of fake ports in `root/usr/ports`. Then you can execute

  export PATH=`pwd`/root/usr/sbin:$PATH

and play with spmk, spmk_add, spmk_rm.
